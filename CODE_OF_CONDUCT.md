# Employes Covenant Code of Conduct

At Stack Learner Software Company, we are committed to providing a respectful, collaborative, and inclusive work environment. We expect all employees to abide by our Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

In order to promote a positive environment, it is important to exhibit contributing behaviors such as using inclusive language, respecting diverse viewpoints, accepting constructive criticism gracefully, prioritizing the community's best interests, and showing empathy towards other members. On the other hand, unacceptable participant behavior includes using, engaging in trolling or derogatory comments, launching personal or political attacks, engaging in public or private harassment, sharing private information of others without their explicit consent, and engaging in other conduct that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

As responsible individuals, project maintainers hold the duty to explain the standards of acceptable behavior and must take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable conduct. Project maintainers also hold the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any comments, commits, codes, wiki edits, issues, or other employ that do not comply with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they find inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project manager at example@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

We are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and positive workplace environment for all. Thank you for your cooperation in upholding this Code of Conduct.

Happy Coding ðŸ¥°
